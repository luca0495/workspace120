&lt;p&gt;Java 9 is finally out the door and Eclipse is ready, with Java 9 support provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Eclipse JDT project&lt;/a&gt;. EclipseCon Europe talks will bring you up to speed on trends in the Java world and introduce you to the technologies and ecosystem behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/news/java-eclipsecon-europe&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive block-center&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/sites/default/files/styles/solstice_news_-_default_-_thumbnail/public/news/Java.png?itok=gX0N_jxt&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Doug Schaefer: Happy 15'th Anniversary CDT!</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://cdtdoug.ca/tag/eclipse/rss/59d39e1b4bfcdf78894a43ad</guid>
	<link>https://cdtdoug.ca/happy-15th-anniversary-cdt/</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;kg-card-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I was putting together my slides for EclipseCon, I occasionally like to bring up the forum post from John Duimovich, the Tools PMC lead, that announced the changes QNX was bringing to the CDT project, the birth of the new CDT project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDT started out as this remote development thing built by the mainframe tools team at IBM, with the remote parts of that evolving into RSE. With the reboot of the project, QNX brought what we have today, essentially a JDT look alike that added C/C++-things like calling ‘make’ to do builds and a gdb integration called CDI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is link and excerpt of that post. What hit me now was that happened in the summer of 2002. That makes CDT officially 15 years old! Happy Anniversary CDT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to everyone who has helped us over those years grow this thing into the best industry leading community built C/C++ IDE we all know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to give a special thanks to the original team that started it here at QNX, some are still at the company, some moved on, and to Sebastien Marineau who was our first project lead and a great community builder who I still struggle to live up to 😊.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a huge thanks to everyone who is helping today and are thinking of coming on board to help us take CDT into the next 15 years. It doesn’t happen without you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/11372/&quot;&gt;https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/11372/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: &quot;John Duimovich&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Newsgroups: eclipse.tools.cdt&lt;br /&gt;
Subject: [ANN] - CDT project changes Date: Fri, 7 Jun 2002 17:20:34 -040&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse Tools PMC is pleased to announce some exciting developments to the CDT project hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.org&quot;&gt;eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;. First, QNX will be contributing some C/C++ core technology from their recently announced product to &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.org&quot;&gt;eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;. We believe that this will enhance the value of the technology hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.org&quot;&gt;eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt; and bring some industrial strength technology into the CDT project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Eclipse Tools PMC has been working on getting additional cross-company project participation on the C/C++ project (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/cdt&quot;&gt;www.eclipse.org/cdt&lt;/a&gt;). There has been lot of interest from many of the eclipse member companies and the community at large on this project and we've been working with many of them in helping them get involved with the C/C++ project at &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.org&quot;&gt;eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this additional participation we're excited to be able to announce that there is a new project leader, Sebastien Marineau from QNX who has agreed to lead the C/C++ IDE (CDT) project on &lt;a href=&quot;http://Eclipse.org&quot;&gt;Eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;. In his role as project leader, there will be a re-plan of the V2.0 CDT deliverables to include the new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Doug Schaefer: Just in time for Halloween, Ghost</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://cdtdoug.ca/tag/eclipse/rss/59d2eb504bfcdf78894a43a7</guid>
	<link>https://cdtdoug.ca/just-in-time-for-halloween-ghost/</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;kg-card-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started my blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdtdoug.ca/welcome-to-my-blog/&quot;&gt;almost 12 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, I chose Blogger. For the time it was really cool, being able to easily create content on-line and publish with a click of a button. It served me well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I decided I needed to upgrade my skills and learn more about web development. With servers at Digital Ocean only $5 a month, I dove in. Everyone seemed to be throwing love at Wordpress so I chose that and started &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdtdoug.ca&quot;&gt;cdtdoug.ca&lt;/a&gt; importing all my posts from Blogger. PHP and MySQL can be pretty taxing on a $5/month server but I managed to find settings to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As things tend to go, we started doing real web development at work and I ended up using a lot of those skills I gained working with my own server. I learned a lot about AWS and quickly fell in love with the power of it. I chose to grab a free year and I migrated cdtdoug over to an AWS machine. I love how developer friendly Digital Ocean is, but AWS is, well, AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the free year ran out and I was running on a $10/month server. And I really wanted to do other things with this server and Wordpress was taking a lot of juice. Googling around for alternatives, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org&quot;&gt;I ran across Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. Ghost runs on node instead of PHP and when run with the SQLite option, it's very lightweight and fast. If I become super famous, it probably won't scale, but I don't think I need to worry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set up a new server, a $5/month t2.nano and migrated my Wordpress blog to Ghost with Disqus for comments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/migrating-your-wordpress-blog-to-ghost/&quot;&gt;I used mainly this guide (click)&lt;/a&gt; and the Ghost docs themselves. It went pretty smooth and I'm pretty happy with it so far. It force me to learn Markdown (what was so wrong with WSIWYG?). And it leaves a lot of room, even on this tiny server, to do some IoT things I've been meaning to try. It'll do for now, until I get the itch to change it yet again.&lt;/p&gt;

This year is particularly special for Orange because we are officially joining the Eclipse Foundation. Smart home represents for us the natural extension of our core business, telecommunications, and Eclipse represents to us a wonderful community of both open source developers and partners working together to think and built the future of smart home.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Ian Skerrett: 5 Trends to Watch in the Java Ecosystem</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/?p=4330</guid>
	<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/IanSkerrett/~3/KYDnbCQzfzE/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of months a number of announcements have been made that change the the Java ecosystem. These changes could have a long-term impact on Java developers and the Eclipse community. This week at JavaOne I expect we will hear about a lot of these changes. For the most part I think there are 5 key trends that all Java developers will need to watch.  If you can’t make it to JavaOne, many of these trends will also be highlighted at EclipseCon Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Adoption of Java 9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 9 is finally out the door. This release has been a long time in development so now the process of adoption will begin. First step in adoption is making sure developers tools work with Java 9.  Eclipse JDT supports Java 9 from day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At EclipseCon Europe, there are a number of sessions focused on Java 9, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/eclipse-and-java%E2%84%A2-9&quot;&gt;Eclipse JDT supports Java 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/%E2%80%9C-future-async%E2%80%9D-or-java-concurrency-change-time&quot;&gt;Session on Java 9 Reactive Streams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/jdt-embraces-java%E2%84%A2-9-insiders-view&quot;&gt;JDT embraces Java™ 9 – An insiders’ view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/java-se-9-and-application-server&quot;&gt;Experience report on using Java 9 as an application server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. A more open Java SE future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle has made two key announcements for Java SE and openJDK: 1) openJDK is moving to a 6 month release schedule. This should allow for more rapid innovation in Java SE but it will have an impact of the overall ecosystem, and 2) openJDK will start shipping Java SE binaries that are equivalent to the Oracle JDK. This essentially removes the field of use restrictions for Java SE. This could have a big impact for Java in areas like the Internet of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Smith, the Oracle Product Manger for Java SE, will be talking about the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/java-se-current-status&quot;&gt;status of Java SE&lt;/a&gt; and future changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Release of Eclipse OpenJ9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Earlier this year, IBM announced their intention to open source their J9 VM. The first release of the Eclipse OpenJ9 is now available and the response has been very positive. The potential of having another production ready Java virtual machine available in open source is going to given Java developers more choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Grace from the Eclipse OpenJ9 project will be giving an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/introducing-openj9-eclipses-new-java-vm-sponsored-ibm&quot;&gt;introduction to OpenJ9 at ECE.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. A focus on Java microservices with Eclipse Microprofile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement towards microservices architecture is a theme pervasive across the entire software industry. Creating and deploying Java as microservices is something I expect we will hear a lot about at JavaOne and beyond.  The Eclipse Microprofile project is working very hard and fast to create specifications for Java microservices. The project has accomplish a lot over the last year and I expect we will hear a lot more in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At EclipseCon Europe, lots of sessions from the leaders in the Microprofile project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/eclipse-microprofile-what-it-it-javaee-replacement&quot;&gt;Eclipse MicroProfile: What is it? Is it a JavaEE replacement?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/microprofile-java-ee-and-application-server-oh-my&quot;&gt;MicroProfile, Java EE, and the Application Server — Oh My!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/monitoring-aspects-eclipse-microprofile&quot;&gt;The Monitoring aspects of Eclipse MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/eclipse-microprofile-config-and-osgi-config-admin&quot;&gt;Eclipse MicroProfile Config and OSGi Config Admin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5. Java EE Moves to the Eclipse Foundation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Oracles announcement to move Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation will be something to watch in the coming year. Oracle is moving very fast and the large Java EE community to beginning to engage. It is definitely going to be a process that will need the contribution of many many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At EclipseCon Europe we will have two talks on Java EE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Delabassée from Oracle will give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/java-ee-8-final-now-what&quot;&gt;Java EE 8 is final… Now what?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/opening-java-ee-panel-discussion&quot;&gt;panel to discuss&lt;/a&gt; the process of moving Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year at JavaOne, the Java ecosystem could be substantially different. It is definitely going to be more open and in my experience that will bring a lot of innovation. For the Eclipse community, it is exciting that the Eclipse Foundation is becoming the home for many of the open source communities for Java developers. If you don’t make it to JavaOne, plan to attend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/&quot;&gt;EclipseCon Europe&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about these key Java trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/ianskerrett.wordpress.com/4330/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/ianskerrett.wordpress.com/4330/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=ianskerrett.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=405862&amp;amp;post=4330&amp;amp;subd=ianskerrett&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IanSkerrett/~4/KYDnbCQzfzE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Karsten Thoms: Resolve NullPointerException in ModelServiceImpl constructor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://kthoms.wordpress.com/?p=793</guid>
	<link>https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/resolve-nullpointerexception-in-modelserviceimpl-constructor/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I was creating a launch configuration for a plug-in test and wanted to have only a minimal set of plugins configured. Thus I am using PDE to add all required plug-ins of the test. The “Validate Plug-ins” action does not recognize any issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot 3.png&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-798&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screenshot-3.png?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when starting the test it fails with a &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;ModelServiceImpl&lt;/code&gt;‘s constructor. The reason here is that no instance of &lt;code&gt;IEventBroker&lt;/code&gt; was retrieved from the application context. To enhance the situation I have opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=522051&quot;&gt;Bug#522051&lt;/a&gt; and giving this as an error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this issue when running on Equinox, the bundle &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.eclipse.equinox.event&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; has to be added to the launch configuration. Also configure this bundle to start automatically at start level 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot 4.png&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-814&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screenshot-4.png?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have liked to give this hint already with the improved error message, but theoretically the &lt;code&gt;IEventBroker&lt;/code&gt; could be also provided by another OSGi implementation, so this additional hint was rejected with reason. I hope that this post will help you then further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kthoms.wordpress.com/793/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kthoms.wordpress.com/793/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kthoms.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=6829080&amp;amp;post=793&amp;amp;subd=kthoms&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Mike Milinkovich: On Naming, or Why EE4J Does Not Suck</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/?p=1387</guid>
	<link>https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/on-naming/</link>
	<description>&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;“You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.” — Inigo Montoya, The Princess Bride, on Vizzini’s use of the word “inconceivable”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On Thursday we &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/introducing-ee4j/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j/charter&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;draft top-level project charter&lt;/a&gt; for Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) was available for community feedback. Since that time, we haven’t received any feedback on the charter, but we have certainly had a lot of passionate feedback on the choice of name. If I could, I would summarize the bulk of the feedback that we’ve seen as “…EE4J is a pretty good acronym, but WTF is Eclipse doing in the name?” A lot of that feedback is based on some incorrect assumptions about what the EE4J name means. Which is totally my fault, because my initial blog post did not provide any context for how EE4J will be used, and not used, as a name and a brand. Hopefully this post will correct that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Before I begin, I have to mention that a very large caveat on everything that follows. This post is based on my best guess on how things are going to work out, with the information I have at this moment. However, there are a significant number of agreements that have to be discussed regarding names, trademarks, and so on that have not yet been completed. It is possible that the future will not unfold as I think it will. So with that said….&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EE4J is not the brand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I think that many people are assuming that EE4J will become the brand that replaces Java EE. Wrong. Java EE is a certification mark. To label something as “Java EE”, you need to get a license from Oracle and pass the TCKs. There are many implementations of Java EE such as WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, and Glassfish. EE4J is the name of the top-level project  at the Eclipse Foundation. As such it is the umbrella under which the source code and TCKs for Glassfish, EclipseLink, and (hopefully) Eclipse MicroProfile will exist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are months away from even starting to define the specification process that will be used in the future. However, when we do I expect that this new process will create a new certification mark which can be properly considered the new “Java EE” name. We will be engaging with the community in the selection of that name. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The existing project names will continue to be used&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I have seen some comments along the lines of “…it’ll be weird to install Eclipse Enterprise for Java into IntelliJ”. I’m actually pretty sure that what people will be installing is more likely to be called something like Eclipse Glassfish, or Eclipse MicroProfile. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Again, EE4J is the name of the top-level project at Eclipse. The projects within EE4J will continue to have their own identity, just as they do today. The committers and the PMC for EE4J will be deciding what artifacts they will be releasing and whether anything actually ships under the name EE4J. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. But only time will tell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The solution space is smaller than you think&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Anyone who has ever built and maintained a large piece of software knows that naming is hard. Naming widely used technologies that take on a brand identity and which require trademarking are harder still. Selecting the EE4J name had to solve a number of real world constraints:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We wanted it to contain the word Java, but it also had to comply with the Java trademark guidelines. Oracle is the only entity that can use the word Java at the beginning of a name. Which meant that using “for Java” was pretty much a fixed requirement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Whether you call it JEE, J2EE, or Java EE for the entire life of the enterprise Java platform “EE” has been in the name. Continuing that tradition provides some clear benefits in terms of continuity and brand recognition. For what it is worth, we basically selected the acronym first and then backed into what the letters in the acronym might mean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The name has to be available to be trademarked. We actually ran full legal trademark searches on a couple of alternate names, and EE4J was the clear winner in terms of availability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hopefully this post provides some context for the naming choice that will help people understand what EE4J is, and is not, as a project name, brand, and trademark. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As Mark Little of Red Hat said &lt;a href=&quot;https://planet.jboss.org/post/ee4j_life_beyond_java_ee_begins_today&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in his post earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of pent-up passion and energy around Java EE and it would be so much better if individuals focused that on the charter at this point than complaining about the name. Yes, I understand that some people feel the name is important to the success of this effort but I can tell you all that there’s a lot more to choosing a name for a foundation or massively successful project than just … choosing the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The passion and commitment of the people in the Java EE community is amazing. Working with this community and welcoming you all to Eclipse is an opportunity and a responsibility that all of us at the Eclipse Foundation take very seriously. The future success of EE4J and the enterprise Java platform is going to be determined by whether we can get you talented, smart, and passionate Javaistas to contribute to the projects and the community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I am looking forward to JavaOne next week, and hope to see many of you there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Comments and discussion are welcomed over on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/ee4j-community&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ee4j-community list&lt;/a&gt;.

	<title>Ian Skerrett: Annual Donation Campaign: End User Support for the Eclipse Foundation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that is mainly funded by fees from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/membership/exploreMembership.php&quot;&gt;corporate members&lt;/a&gt;. Our corporate members definitely get a lot of value from their involvement with the Eclipse Foundation. Their support of the Eclipse Foundation is essential to the ongoing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also millions of software developers who make use of Eclipse technology on a daily basis. For the most part these developers and their organization use the Eclipse IDE and other projects free of charge. Of course this is perfectly fine given the open source license for Eclipse projects. However, to sustain a community the size of the Eclipse Foundation requires ongoing support and resources. End user support for open source foundations, including the Eclipse Foundation, is important to the ongoing sustainability of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage end-user support,  we are launching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/donate/&quot;&gt;October Donation Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to have over 1000 individuals donate to the Eclipse Foundation and help support the overall community. Last year we ran our first annual donation campaign which resulted in 847 people donating to our community.  This year I am sure we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take the time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/donate/&quot;&gt;donate to the Eclipse Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. For those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/donate/donorlist.php&quot;&gt;who have donated&lt;/a&gt; in the past, thank you! You will also notice that we now accept credit cards. This will make it easier for people who can’t/won’t use Paypal or bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Mike Milinkovich: Introducing EE4J: The first  step towards Java EE at the Eclipse Foundation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/?p=1382</guid>
	<link>https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/introducing-ee4j/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;I am very excited and proud to introduce the new top-level &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j/charter&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. For those that might not have heard, Oracle has announced their intention to move Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation. Creating the EE4J top-level project is the first step to making this a reality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/java-ee-moves-to-the-eclipse-foundation/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Moving Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; is going to be an exciting and massive undertaking. It is a significant opportunity to use the Eclipse open development model to accelerate innovation in Java for enterprise and cloud native computing. We look forward to engaging with the millions of developers and organizations using Java EE. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Java EE technology is a very large portfolio of source code, TCKs and specifications. Moving all of Java EE will be a significant undertaking for the community. For instance,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The GlassFish open source project includes 130 github repos. Moving these existing GlassFish open source projects to the Eclipse Foundation, and getting all of the various sub-projects set up and under the Eclipse development process will take some time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The Java EE TCKs will be moved to Eclipse open source projects and be available to the community.  What this means and how the community interacts with the TCKs needs to be defined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Create an open build infrastructure so EE4J can be built and tested by the community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Establish a new specification process under the auspices of the Eclipse Foundation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The good news is Oracle, along with IBM and Red Hat, is moving incredibly fast. Publishing the top-level project charter is an important first step. However, we are aware that there are literally millions of developers who have a vested interest in the future of the enterprise edition of the Java Platform, and who quite rightfully would like to have detailed plans now for how and when the above list are going to be completed. Unfortunately, the details are going to take some time to plan and execute. Moving Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation is going to be process, not an event. I do expect this will be an open process that encourages community members to contribute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Today marks a very significant milestone in our journey. We are pleased to announce that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j/charter&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;draft charter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; for the Eclipse Enterprise for Java top-level project is now available for community review and feedback. We have created the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/ee4j-community&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;ee4j-community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; mailing list for the community to use to provide that feedback, so please subscribe to the list and join the conversation!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filed under: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/category/foundation/&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/category/open-source/&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/mmilinkov.wordpress.com/1382/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/mmilinkov.wordpress.com/1382/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=mmilinkov.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=19461799&amp;amp;post=1382&amp;amp;subd=mmilinkov&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Maximilian and Jonas: EMF Support for Che – Day 6: Adding your own editor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://eclipsesource.com/?p=35566</guid>
	<link>https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2017/09/28/emf-support-for-che-day-6-adding-your-own-editor/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog series, we share our experiences extending &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/che/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Che&lt;/a&gt; to add EMF support. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2017/02/08/emf-support-for-che-day-0-motivation-and-getting-started/&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; covers our goals. In the last post, we have focused on how to extend Che by adding a custom plugin. So far, we have registered a file extension for +.ecore files and can control the editor to be opened for this file type. We still can open a plain text editor for Ecore files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to add a custom editor to support modeling in Ecore as you are used to in classic Eclipse. The existing editor for EMF is written in SWT, we therefore cannot simply reuse it, as we &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2017/02/23/emf-support-for-che-day-2-generating-code/&quot;&gt;did for the code generation&lt;/a&gt;. So, let’s have a look at the different options to implement a new Ecore editor within Che. As described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2017/02/08/emf-support-for-che-day-0-motivation-and-getting-started/&quot;&gt;first blog post&lt;/a&gt;, our first goal is a form-based editor such as the default Ecore tooling rather than a textual or graphical editor. However, the following considerations are pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Che provides a flexible extension mechanism to register editors based on the corresponding file type, as well as a frame (tab) for the same (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/assemblies/sdk-code-editors/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for more details). Therefore, we primarily  need to consider the inner part of our editor, meaning the part showing the actual content of the file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For this, we have basically three choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Extend the existing code editor (which is based on Orion)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Write a new Editor using GWT (Che is implemented with GWT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Embed an existing HTML/JavaScript component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to modify any text-based artefact, the first option is probably the simplest and best choice. In this case, you would extend the Orion editor with custom syntax highlighting, code completion, etc. Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/assemblies/sdk-code-editors/index.html#code-completion&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for more details. For our Ecore Editor, we are aiming for a form-based solution, so for us, the Orion editor is not really an option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option, using the Google Widget Toolkit, is probably the simplest one if you need to implement an editor from scratch. As you use the same technology as the surrounding application (Che), integration is straight-forward and you can directly use all of the Che APIs. Finally, you can implement your editor in Java (as supported by GWT). However, you need GWT experience and the GWT ecosystem is not as active anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third option is actually the most flexible one. As Che is an HTML/JavaScript application, you could potentially embed any web framework you prefer to create an editor. This gives you access to the very vital ecosystem of HTML/JavaScript frameworks. It also makes your editor independant of Che, such that you can write it once and also use a stand-alone solution or embed it into another web IDE such as Atom or Theia. Further, this option makes your development cycle more efficient. You can first develop a stand-alone component with very short build cycles and easy debugging, and then later, embed it into the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed, we have chosen the third option for our Ecore Editor prototype. Before we present the actual editor, let us look more in detail at the way to embed HTML into an existing GWT application (Che). The basic idea is described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/assemblies/sdk-embed-htmljs/index.html&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To embed our own existing HTML/JavaScript component in Che we need to accomplish three tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Include our own HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Include our own Javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Include our own CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Che uses the Model-View-Presenter pattern &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/mvp-architecture.html&quot;&gt;recommended by the GWT developers&lt;/a&gt; to implement everything UI related, ranging from simple popups to more complex editors. For embedding HTML in Che you can extend and configure the provided BaseView class. This allows you to register a special &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinder.html&quot;&gt;GWT-UI Binder xml file&lt;/a&gt; in which you can specify your own HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To embed your Javascript you need to implement a presenter. For editors, Che provides the AbstractEditorPresenter which already includes useful functionality like dirty-state-handling. In your implementation you can call the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gwtproject.org/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/core/client/ScriptInjector.html&quot;&gt;GWT ScriptInjector&lt;/a&gt; to inject your Javascript files when the editor initializes. Once they are loaded you must call the previously implemented view to show your defined HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, you then need to communicate with your Javascript library, for example to provide data coming from Che. For this you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsOverlay.html&quot;&gt;GTW Overlays&lt;/a&gt;. Overlays are Java classes representing JavaScript objects. You can use them within your implemented view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add your CSS at the same point where you register your plugin extension by adding it to the Che HTML document. However you should make sure to scope your CSS classes so they do not overwrite CSS defined by Che.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-35591 size-full&quot; height=&quot;465&quot; src=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/image2.png&quot; width=&quot;797&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you only need to register your editor presenter for an existing or newly defined file type so that the custom HTML/JavaScript component is rendered and that is basically it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows a simple custom editor which displays statically defined HTML via the BasicView approach described above. Stay tuned for the next blog days where we show how to use the Model-View-Presenter pattern to embed our own, more complex, stand-alone UI component into Che, which will show the contents of an Ecore file.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Michael Spector: Profiling Spark Applications: The Easy Way</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-34385728.post-4362206950328131090</guid>
	<link>http://spektom.blogspot.com/2017/06/profiling-spark-applications-easy-way.html</link>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Recently, I thought about some one-click way to profile Spark applications, so it could be easily integrated in any work environment without the need to configure the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The modern way to report profile statistics about an application (any application, not just Spark or Java application) is generating a single .SVG file called &quot;flame graph&quot;. Since this is a regular vector graphic format, the file can be opened in any browser. Moreover, you can navigate between different stack frames by clicking on them, and even search for a symbol name by clicking on &quot;Search&quot; link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how sample flame graph looks like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width&quot; contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;slate-image-embed__toolbar&quot; style=&quot;background-position: 0px 0px; border: 0px; height: 48px; line-height: 32px; padding: 0px 0px 8px; vertical-align: baseline; width: 744px;&quot;&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;background-position: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: inline-block; margin: 0px 4px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;slate-image-embed-button__resize-left slate-image-embed-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;background-position: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: inline-block; margin: 0px 4px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;slate-image-embed-button__resize-middle slate-image-embed-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;background-position: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: inline-block; margin: 0px 4px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;slate-image-embed-button__resize-full-width slate-image-embed-button slate-image-embed-button__active&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;background-position: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: inline-block; margin: 0px 4px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;slate-image-embed-button__resize-bleed slate-image-embed-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;background-position: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: inline-block; margin: 0px 4px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;slate-image-embed-button__resize-right slate-image-embed-button&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;slate-image-embed__resize-full-width&quot; src=&quot;https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAt_AAAAJDQ4YTE2NTE3LTc1ZGEtNDk1OC04MTQ0LWNhNWJhMzFlMTI2Mg.png&quot; style=&quot;background-position: 0px 0px; border: 0px; display: inline-block; height: auto; margin: 0px auto; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; width: 744px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The y-axis shows the stack depth while the x-axis shows time spent in a stack frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to generate flame graphs, there are two mandatory processes usually: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capture stack traces from a running process, and dump them to disk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parse these stack traces, and generate .SVG file. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;For Java based applications it stack traces can be gathered using commercial features of Oracle JDK (using -XX:+FlightRecorder option). There's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kayousterhout/7008a8ebf2babeedc7ce6f8723fd1bf4&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to profile Spark applications using this option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In OpenJDK this feature is not available, but luckily there are other options. Once of them is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/statsd-jvm-profiler&quot;&gt;statsd JVM profiler&lt;/a&gt; library from &lt;a href=&quot;http://etsy.com/&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;. This library integrates as agent into JVM, gathers statistics like CPU or memory usage, and send it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/statsd&quot;&gt;statsd&lt;/a&gt; server in real time. Apparently, this library supports reporting to InfluxDB &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etsy/statsd-jvm-profiler/blob/master/src/main/java/com/etsy/statsd/profiler/reporter/InfluxDBReporter.java&quot;&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Keeping the above in mind, the whole process will look like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have InfluxDB running on random port.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start Spark with the statsd profiler Jar in its classpath and with the configuration that tells it to report statistics back to the InfluxDB instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After running Spark application, query all the reported metrics from the InfluxDB instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run a script that generates the target report.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stop the InfluxDB instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store generated .SVG file somewhere, or send it to someone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The following script is a wrapper to ‘spark-submit’ command, which does all that:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spektom/spark-flamegraph/blob/master/spark-submit-flamegraph&quot;&gt;https://github.com/spektom/spark-flamegraph/blob/master/spark-submit-flamegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the sake of justice, it should be noted that the following utilities must present on your system prior to running the script: perl, python2.7 and pip. Otherwise, the script was used in Amazon EMR environment without any issues. Just use the script instead of usual spark-submit command, and it will profile your application. and create a report:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;[hadoop@ip-10-121-4-244 tmp]$ ./spark-submit-flamegraph --name 'etlite' --jars file://$(pwd)/probe-events-1.0.jar etlite_2.11-0.1.0.jar s3://mobility-artifacts/airflow/latest/config/etlite.conf&lt;br /&gt;[2017-06-05T12:34:05] Installing dependencies&lt;br /&gt;[2017-06-05T12:34:09] Starting InfluxDB&lt;br /&gt;[2017-06-05T12:34:10] Executing: spark-submit --jars /home/hadoop/.spark-flamegraph/statsd-jvm-profiler.jar,file:///tmp/probe-events-1.0.jar --conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-javaagent:statsd-jvm-profiler.jar=server=10.121.4.244,port=48081,reporter=InfluxDBReporter,database=profiler,username=profiler,password=profiler,prefix=sparkapp,tagMapping=spark --name etlite etlite_2.11-0.1.0.jar s3://mobility-artifacts/airflow/latest/config/etlite.conf&lt;br /&gt;17/06/05 12:34:11 INFO Main$: Configuration file = 's3://mobility-artifacts/airflow/latest/config/etlite.conf'&lt;br /&gt;17/06/05 12:34:14 INFO S3NativeFileSystem: Opening 's3://mobility-artifacts/airflow/latest/config/etlite.conf' for reading&lt;br /&gt;17/06/05 12:34:15 INFO SparkContext: Running Spark version 2.1.0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... running Spark application ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17/06/05 12:35:17 INFO SparkContext: Successfully stopped SparkContext&lt;br /&gt;17/06/05 12:35:17 INFO ShutdownHookManager: Shutdown hook called&lt;br /&gt;17/06/05 12:35:17 INFO ShutdownHookManager: Deleting directory /mnt/tmp/spark-fa12133c-b605-4a73-814a-2dfd4ed6fdde&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... generating .svg file ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[2017-06-05T12:35:25] Created flamegraph: /tmp/flamegraph.svg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Integrating this script into Airflow Spark operator is straightforward, especially if your Spark operator is derived from BashOperator. Just make sure the script is available on all Spark Airflow workers, then do the replacement of spark-submit command depending on whether profile=True is passed as the operator argument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post your weird flame graphs in comments! :)&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>vert.x project: An Eclipse Vert.x Gradle Plugin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://vertx.io/blog/an-eclipse-vert-x-gradle-plugin</guid>
	<link>http://vertx.io/blog/an-eclipse-vert-x-gradle-plugin</link>
	<description>&lt;article&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Vert.x is a versatile toolkit, and as such it does not have any strong opinion on the tools that you should be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradle is a popular build tool in the JVM ecosystem, and it is quite easy to use for building Vert.x project as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/blob/master/gradle-verticles/gradle-verticle/build.gradle&quot;&gt;show in one of the &lt;code&gt;vertx-examples&lt;/code&gt; samples&lt;/a&gt; where a so-called &lt;em&gt;fat Jar&lt;/em&gt; is being produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.vertx.vertx-plugin&quot;&gt;Vert.x Gradle plugin&lt;/a&gt; offers an &lt;em&gt;opinionated&lt;/em&gt; plugin for building Vert.x applications with Gradle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It automatically applies the following plugins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt; (and sets the source compatibility to Java 8),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;shadow&lt;/code&gt; to generate fat Jars with all dependencies bundled,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nebula-dependency-recommender-plugin&lt;/code&gt; so that you can omit versions from modules from the the Vert.x stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin automatically adds &lt;code&gt;io.vertx:vertx-core&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;compile&lt;/code&gt; dependency, so you don’t need to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin provides a &lt;code&gt;vertxRun&lt;/code&gt; task that can take advantage of the Vert.x auto-reloading capabilities, so you can just run it then have your code being automatically compiled and reloaded as you make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minimal &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs groovy&quot;&gt;plugins {
  id &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'io.vertx.vertx-plugin'&lt;/span&gt; version &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'0.0.4'&lt;/span&gt;
}

repositories {
  jcenter()
}

vertx {
  mainVerticle = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'sample.App'&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided &lt;code&gt;sample.App&lt;/code&gt; is a Vert.x verticle, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gradle shadowJar&lt;/code&gt; builds an executable Jar with all dependencies: &lt;code&gt;java -jar build/libs/simple-project-fat.jar&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gradle vertxRun&lt;/code&gt; starts the application and automatically recompiles (&lt;code&gt;gradle classes&lt;/code&gt;) and reloads the code when any file under &lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt; is being added, modified or deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-with-kotlin-or-groovy-or-&quot;&gt;Using with Kotlin (or Groovy, or…)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin integrates well with plugins that add configurations and tasks triggered by the &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt; task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how to use the plugin with Kotlin (replace the version numbers with the latest ones…):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs groovy&quot;&gt;plugins {
  id &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'io.vertx.vertx-plugin'&lt;/span&gt; version &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'x.y.z'&lt;/span&gt;
  id &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm'&lt;/span&gt; version &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'a.b.c'&lt;/span&gt;
}

repositories {
  jcenter()
}

dependencies {
  compile &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'io.vertx:vertx-lang-kotlin'&lt;/span&gt;
  compile &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jre8'&lt;/span&gt;
}

vertx {
  mainVerticle = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;sample.MainVerticle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
}

tasks.withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile).all {
  kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;1.8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-with-webpack-or-any-other-custom-task-&quot;&gt;Using with WebPack (or any other custom task)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebPack is popular to bundle web assets, and there is even &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.gradle.org/running-webpack-with-gradle/&quot;&gt;a guide for its integration with Gradle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixing the Vert.x Gradle plugin with WebPack is very simple, especially in combination with the &lt;code&gt;com.moowork.node&lt;/code&gt; plugin that integrates Node into Gradle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to mix Vert.x code and JavaScript with Gradle and WebPack.
We assume a &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs javascript&quot;&gt;{
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;webpack-sample&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;version&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;0.0.1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;A sample with Vert.x, Gradle and Webpack&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;main&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;src/main/webapp/index.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: {
    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  },
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;license&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;ISC&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;devDependencies&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: {
    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;webpack&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;^2.7.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  },
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;dependencies&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: {
    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;axios&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;^0.16.2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;code&gt;webpack.config.js&lt;/code&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;.exports = {
  entry: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'./src/main/webapp/index.js'&lt;/span&gt;,
  output: {
    filename: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'./build/resources/main/webroot/bundle.js'&lt;/span&gt;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; file is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs groovy&quot;&gt;plugins {
  id &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'io.vertx.vertx-plugin'&lt;/span&gt; version &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'0.0.4'&lt;/span&gt;
  id &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'com.moowork.node'&lt;/span&gt; version &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'1.2.0'&lt;/span&gt;
}

repositories {
  jcenter()
}

dependencies {
  compile &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;io.vertx:vertx-web&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
}

vertx {
  mainVerticle = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;sample.MainVerticle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  watch = [&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;src/**/*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;build.gradle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;yarn.lock&quot;&lt;/span&gt;]
  onRedeploy = [&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;classes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;webpack&quot;&lt;/span&gt;]
}

task webpack(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;type:&lt;/span&gt; Exec) {
  inputs.file(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;$projectDir/yarn.lock&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  inputs.file(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;$projectDir/webpack.config.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  inputs.dir(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;$projectDir/src/main/webapp&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  outputs.dir(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;$buildDir/resources/main/webroot&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  commandLine &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;$projectDir/node_modules/.bin/webpack&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This custom build exposes a &lt;code&gt;webpack&lt;/code&gt; task that invokes WebPack, with proper file tracking so that Gradle knows when the task is up-to-date or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node plugin adds many tasks, and integrates fine with &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;, so fetching all NPM dependencies is done by calling &lt;code&gt;./gradlew yarn&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;vertxRun&lt;/code&gt; task now redeploys on modifications to files in &lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt; (and sub-folders), &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yarn.lock&lt;/code&gt;, calling both the &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;webpack&lt;/code&gt; tasks:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vert.x Gradle plugin provides lots of defaults to configure a Gradle project for Vert.x applications, producing &lt;em&gt;fat Jars&lt;/em&gt; and offering a running task with automatic redeployment.
The plugin also integrates well with other plugins and external tools for which a Gradle task is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is still in its early stages and we are looking forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OSGi IoT Demo for the OSGi Community Event and EclipseCon 2017 has been updated and extended to deliver another interesting and informative showcase of OSGi in action in IoT. Taking the foundations from the last three years of demos we will be using products from multiple vendors, open source projects and Raspberry PI computers to operate and control LEGO® trains running around a track. For 2017, we add a new and exciting dimension: a robot that will interact with the trains.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Eclipse Announcements: Eclipse IDE Now Supports Java 9</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/eclipse/fnews/~3/UJKoa-MInJk/</guid>

	<description>Java 9 has been released into the world and support to make your Eclipse IDE ready to build, run, and debug Java 9 applications is available from the Eclipse Marketplace.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/eclipse/fnews/~4/UJKoa-MInJk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wayne Beaton: Running Eclipse IDE on Java 9</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/?p=5177</guid>
	<link>https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2017/09/25/running-eclipse-ide-on-java-9/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, Java 9 makes only a subset of the modules available to applications. If your application makes use of APIs from other modules, you need to configure the JVM to make those modules available. The Eclipse IDE its itself a Java application that uses APIs from modules outside of that default group, so a little extra configuration is needed to make it run on Java 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your Eclipse IDE installation directory, you’ll find the eclipse.ini file that your Eclipse IDE uses for configuration information. Add &lt;code&gt;--add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM&lt;/code&gt; after the &lt;code&gt;-vmargs&lt;/code&gt; argument (basically anything that follows the &lt;code&gt;-vmargs&lt;/code&gt; argument is passed to the VM at start up (note that most VMs will barf if you pass in arguments that they don’t know or expect; adding this option when running on a Java 8 JVM will result only in disappointment and frustration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;...
-vm
/path/to/jdk/bin
...
-vmargs
--add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM
...&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more information in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eclipse.org/Configure_Eclipse_for_Java_9&quot;&gt;Eclipse wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we’re pushing out some updates to make it so that the modification is not required. But that will only apply on future versions of Eclipse IDE (e.g. the Oxygen point releases, Photon, and later). For all older versions of Eclipse IDE, you’ll need to make this configuration change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Java 9 support in the Eclipse IDE, including the Java development tools (JDT) and other great features like Eclipse Web Tools, Eclipse Code Recommenders and Eclipse Maven Integration, etc., consider attending &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/&quot;&gt;EclipseCon Europe&lt;/a&gt; in Ludwigsburg, Germany from October 24 – 26, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session-tracks/java-jdt&quot;&gt;Java and JDT track&lt;/a&gt; that includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Roxanne Joncas: “Things” Update — Fall</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello again! It’s been a while. Summer is always a unique time in the office and even thought I had good intentions, I neglected to post here. But, I am writing today with exciting news. I promise the wait will have been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep reading to find out more about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open IoT Challenge 4.0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New Eclipse IoT Newsletter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eclipse IoT Day @ ThingMonk Recordings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All Things IoT @ EclipseCon Europe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open IoT Challenge 4.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to say that we launched the fourth &lt;a href=&quot;http://iot.eclipse.org/open-iot-challenge/&quot;&gt;Open IoT Challenge&lt;/a&gt; today! We are very excited about this one because &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/open-iot-challenge/third-edition/&quot;&gt;last year’&lt;/a&gt;s was such a great success. I have a feeling that this year will be even more awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/open-iot-challenge/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LkqfReZ6ws7tdUBXb0ULaA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Open IoT Challenge 4.0&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Open IoT Challenge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an annual challenge to encourage IoT enthusiasts and developers to build innovative IoT solutions using open standards and open source technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Challenge finally gives you the chance to build the open IoT solution you’ve been dreaming of. We all have these personal plans and awesome ideas, but never seem to find the time to actually work on them. Initiatives like the Challenge give you the opportunity and a set timeframe to commit to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you work hard on your proposal; the 10 best proposals will receive $150 to purchase hardware to make their idea come to life. Don’t be discouraged — even if you don’t make the Top 10, you can still win the Challenge. Everyone who submits a proposal is in the running!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New to the Challenge this year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make it even more interesting, we encourage submitters to make a video or write a blog post explaining why their solution should be in the Top 10. This is optional, but thinking about your proposal thoroughly and writing it down will help you refine your vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are you waiting for — get that proposal ready!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details: &lt;a href=&quot;http://iot.eclipse.org/open-iot-challenge/&quot;&gt;http://iot.eclipse.org/open-iot-challenge/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipse IoT Newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working on the new Eclipse IoT Newsletter. The first issue will be published at the beginning of October and a new one will be published every quarter. This means that I will now be the editor for two newsletters, this new one and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve featured Eclipse IoT articles in the Eclipse Newsletter in the past (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/march/&quot;&gt;March 2017 issue&lt;/a&gt;), but thought there was enough content for it to merit it’s own newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/cYn4-n&quot;&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt; to get it delivered to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/cYn4-n&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*H_4ncyMJHC3S3TZq8saNOA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Subscribe to the Eclipse IoT Newsletter&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipse IoT Day @ ThingMonk Videos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were in London again this September for the Eclipse IoT Day @ ThingMonk. It was an awesome event and we hope you could be there to witness it live. If you weren’t there, you can watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJX-x24NVqs&amp;amp;list=PLy7t4z5SYNaThBSbxvLuhnXIl975hbM63&quot;&gt;talk recordings here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uunF1cbHFRhR6tCBraccow.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Things IoT @ EclipseCon Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/&quot;&gt;EclipseCon Europe&lt;/a&gt; (ECE) has been around for more than a decade. Since 2015, we’ve been organizing co-located Eclipse IoT Days with EclipseCon in Ludwigsburg. This year, there are so many great IoT events and activities happening at and around ECE, that we’ve decided to map it all out for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/iot&quot;&gt;All Things IoT @ ECE&lt;/a&gt; page to get the most IoT out of your time at EclipseCon Europe, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smart Home Day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eclipse IoT Day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eclipse IoT Working Group Meeting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/iot&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ULpJoPyX-dexxF9QMOGVNA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All Things IoT @ ECE&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you Oct 22–26 at all these IoT events in Ludwigsburg! Message me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/roxannejoncas&quot;&gt;@roxannejoncas&lt;/a&gt; if you’re attending. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=d2a9f801037f&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
